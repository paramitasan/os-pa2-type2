/*
 * scheduler.c -- THIS IS THE FILE YOU EDIT.
 *
 * Programming Assignment 2, CSCM602055 Operating Systems.
 *
 * Everything else (loading the workload, creating the threads, the semaphore
 * handshake, the printing) is already written for you in simlib.c. Your job is
 * the scheduling decision itself, and the extra output your topic asks for.
 *
 * Build and run:
 *     make
 *     ./scheduler tests/tc1.txt
 *     ./scheduler tests/tc1.txt -v          (show every state transition)
 *
 * HOW THE SIMULATION WORKS
 * ------------------------
 * Time advances one unit at a time. At each time unit the main loop asks your
 * choose_next() which process should get the CPU. It then calls run_one_tick(),
 * which posts that process's semaphore, lets its thread run for one unit, and
 * waits for it to finish. Exactly one process thread is runnable at any moment,
 * which is why the output is repeatable.
 *
 *     for each time unit t:
 *         admit any process whose arrival time is t   (NEW -> READY)
 *         p = choose_next(...)                        <-- YOUR CODE
 *         if p is NULL: run_idle_tick()
 *         else:         run_one_tick(sim, p)

 * to write a second scheduler to make the comparison.
 *
 * FCFS is non-preemptive: once a process has the CPU it keeps it until its
 * burst is finished. That single property is what produces the convoy effect,
 * where a short job stuck behind a long one waits far longer than it needs to.

 *
 * Compared with the FCFS example above, only three things ever change:

 *        SJF / SRTF   smaller burst / smaller remaining wins
 *        Priority     smaller priority number wins

 *        preemptive       delete it, and re-decide every tick
 *
 *   3. Round Robin and the multilevel algorithms also need to remember how
 *      long the current process has held the CPU. A "static int" local is a
