/*
 * fork_vs_thread.c -- a short demonstration for Programming Assignment 2.
 *
 * Part of the assignment, but deliberately small. It exists to make one point
 * from the W03 lecture concrete:
 *
 *     threads of one process SHARE memory;
 *     a process created by fork() gets its own COPY.
 *
 * That difference is the whole reason your scheduler needs semaphores. The
 * process threads in scheduler.c all see the same Sim struct, so without the
 * semaphore handshake they would race each other.
 *
 * Build:  make fork_vs_thread
 * Run:    ./fork_vs_thread
